# Snake-Game
The Snake Game Project is a classic arcade game implemented in Python, where players control snake that eat food and grow. The objective is to make the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself. This project is an excellent way to understand programming concepts, practice Python skills, and learn about game development.
