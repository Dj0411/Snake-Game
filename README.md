# Snake-Game Project
The Snake Game Project is a classic arcade game implemented in Python, where players control snake that eat food and grow. The objective is to make the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself. This project is an excellent way to understand programming concepts, practice Python skills, and learn about game development.


Code Structure
  1. main.py: The main file that initializes the game and handles the game loop, handling collisions and rendering
     graphics.
  2. snake.py: Contains the Snake class, managing the snake's position, movement, and growth.
  3. food.py: Contains the Food class, responsible for randomly placing food on the game field.
  4. scoreboard.py: Manages game states, including initializing the game, updating the score.

By completing this project, you will:
 1. Gain experience in using the Pygame library for game development.
 2. Understand the basics of game loops, event handling, and rendering graphics.
 3. Learn how to implement collision detection and score tracking.
 4. Develop skills in organizing and structuring a Python project.
